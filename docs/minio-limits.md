### List of Amazon S3 API's not supported on MinIO
We found the following APIs to be redundant or less useful outside of AWS S3. If you have a different view on any of the APIs we missed, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/minio/minio/issues).

#### List of Amazon S3 Bucket API's not supported on MinIO

- BucketACL (Use [bucket policies](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide#policy) instead)
- BucketCORS (CORS enabled by default on all buckets for all HTTP verbs)
- BucketWebsite (Use [`caddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) or [`nginx`](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/))
- BucketAnalytics, BucketMetrics, BucketLogging (Use [bucket notification](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide#events) APIs)
- BucketRequestPayment

#### List of Amazon S3 Object API's not supported on MinIO

- ObjectACL (Use [bucket policies](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide#policy) instead)
- ObjectTorrent

### Object name restrictions on MinIO
Object names that contain characters `^*|\/&";` are unsupported on Windows and other file systems which do not support filenames with these characters. NOTE: This list is not an exhaustive, it depends on the operating system and filesystem under use.

For best experience we recommend that you use distributions that ship fairly recent Linux kernel such as CentOS 8, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS along with XFS as the choice for your backend filesystem.

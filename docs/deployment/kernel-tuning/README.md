# Kernel Tuning for MinIO Production Deployment on Linux Servers [![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/)

List of kernel tuning recommendations for MinIO server deployments, a copy of this [script](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/docs/deployment/kernel-tuning/sysctl.sh) is available here that can be applied on the servers.

> NOTE: These are common recommendations on any Linux servers, users must be careful on any premature optimization.
> These settings are not mandatory, these settings do not fix any hardware issues and should not be considered as an
> alternative to boost performance to mask underlying hardware problems. Under all circumstances it is recommended
> to perform this tuning only after performing benchmarks for the hardware with expected baseline results.

# `Transparent Hugepage Support`*: This is a Linux kernel feature intended to improve
# performance by making more efficient use of processorâ€™s memory-mapping hardware.
# But this may cause https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/performance-issues-with-transparent-huge-pages-thp
# for non-optimized applications. As most Linux distributions set it to `enabled=always` by default,
# we recommend changing this to `enabled=madvise`. This will allow applications optimized
# for transparent hugepages to obtain the performance benefits, while preventing the
# associated problems otherwise. Also, set `transparent_hugepage=madvise` on your kernel
# command line (e.g. in /etc/default/grub) to persistently set this value.
